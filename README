Original README text follows below. This archive was originally copied
from http://oldhome.schmorp.de/marc/fcrackzip.html

The original program spawns an external unzip binary when checking
password guesses (with the -u option). This is extremely slow, so I've
modified the code to use libzip instead. This speeds up guessing by
over a factor of 1000 on my laptop, even with SSD.

libzip is available on mst Linux distros. I believe this program is
largely obsoleted now if you have John the Ripper with the Jumbo patch.
In john-1.7.9-jumbo-7 you can just use zip2john and then run john.

A sample password-protected .zip file is included as "noradi.zip". It's
password has 6 lower case characters, and fcrackzip will find it (and a
number of false positives) with

fcrackzip -b -c a -p aaaaaa ./noradi.zip

which will take between one and thirty minutes on typical machines.

To find out which of these passwords is the right one either try them out
or use the --use-unzip option.
